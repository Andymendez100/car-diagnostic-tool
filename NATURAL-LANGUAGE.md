# 🗣️ Natural Language Car Diagnostic Tool

## 🚗 **New User-Friendly Approach**

The diagnostic tool now uses **natural language descriptions** instead of technical OBD codes, making it accessible to everyone!

### ✅ **Before vs After:**

**❌ Old Way (Technical):**
- User needs to know "P0300" means "Random/Multiple Cylinder Misfire"
- Requires OBD-II scanner to get codes
- Technical jargon intimidating for average users

**✅ New Way (Natural Language):**
- User types "clicking noise from engine"
- System finds matching issues automatically
- Plain English descriptions everyone understands

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **1. Describe Your Problem**
Simply type what you're experiencing:
- "Hearing a clicking noise from the engine"
- "Brakes are squealing when I stop"
- "Car won't start but makes clicking sound"
- "Engine shaking when idling"
- "Steering wheel hard to turn"

### **2. Smart Search & Matching**
The system searches through **25+ common car issues** using:
- **Description matching**: Finds issues based on your words
- **Keyword recognition**: Matches terms like "clicking", "grinding", "squealing"
- **Category filtering**: Groups by Engine, Brakes, Transmission, etc.

### **3. AI-Powered Analysis**
Once you've selected your issues, Gemini AI:
- **Analyzes relationships** between multiple problems
- **Considers your specific vehicle** (make, model, year, mileage)
- **Prioritizes by safety** (critical issues first)
- **Provides cost estimates** and repair timelines

## 📋 **Example Issue Categories:**

### **🔧 Engine Issues:**
- "Clicking noise coming from the engine"
