## 🔍 **Example Interactive Session:**

### **Initial Input:** "My engine makes noise"

**🔧 AI Mechanic Response:**
*"I understand you're hearing some unusual sounds from your engine. Let me help you diagnose this step by step. Engine noises can indicate several different issues, so I'll need to ask a few questions to narrow it down."*

**Response Pills:**
- 💊 "It happens when starting the car" (timing)
- 💊 "I hear it while driving at highway speeds" (timing) 
- 💊 "The sound comes from under the hood" (location)
- 💊 "It only occurs when the engine is cold" (conditions)

---

### **Step 2:** User clicks "It happens when starting the car"

**🔧 AI Mechanic Response:**
*"Got it - so this noise occurs during startup. That helps narrow it down significantly. Now I need to understand what type of sound you're hearing, as different sounds point to different components."*

**Response Pills:**
- 💊 "Rapid clicking sound" (sound)
- 💊 "Grinding or scraping noise" (sound)
- 💊 "High-pitched squealing" (sound)
- 💊 "Knocking or metallic tapping" (sound)

---

### **Step 3:** User clicks "Rapid clicking sound"

**🔧 AI Mechanic Response:**
*"A rapid clicking when starting usually points to electrical issues. This is commonly related to the battery or starter system. Let me determine the severity and specific cause."*

**Response Pills:**
- 💊 "Clicks once then nothing happens" (severity)
- 💊 "Clicks rapidly but engine turns over slowly" (severity)
- 💊 "Clicks rapidly and engine won't turn" (severity)
- 💊 "Clicks then engine starts normally" (frequency)

---

### **Step 4:** User clicks "Clicks rapidly and engine won't turn"

**🔧 Final Diagnosis:**
*"Based on our conversation, I can provide a comprehensive diagnosis of your starting issue."*

**📋 Diagnostic Results:**
- **Analysis:** "Rapid clicking with no engine turnover indicates a weak or dead battery unable to provide sufficient power to the starter motor."
- **Possible Causes:** 
  - Dead or dying battery (most likely)
  - Corroded battery terminals
  - Faulty starter solenoid
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Test battery voltage (should be 12.6V when off)
  - Check and clean battery terminals
  - Jump start to confirm battery issue
  - Replace battery if over 3-4 years old
- **Estimated Cost:** $120 - $200
- **Urgency:** HIGH (you're stranded until fixed)
