## üéØ **Example Professional Session:**

### **Customer Complaint:** "Car hesitates during acceleration"

**Step 1 - AI Analysis:**
*"Analyzing acceleration hesitation complaint. Initiating systematic diagnostic procedure following industry-standard methodology."*

**Response Pills:**
- üíä "Symptom occurs during cold start operation"
- üíä "Issue manifests under load conditions" 
- üíä "Problem occurs during idle/park conditions"
- üíä "Intermittent fault - requires specific conditions"

### **Technician Selection:** "Issue manifests under load conditions"

**Step 2 - Technical Guidance:**
*"Load-related hesitation indicates potential fuel delivery, ignition timing, or air induction issues. Recommend systematic component testing."*

**Response Pills:**
- üíä "Verified with oscilloscope/ignition analysis" 
- üíä "Confirmed through scan tool data analysis"
- üíä "Fuel pressure testing performed"
- üíä "Mass airflow sensor readings evaluated"

### **Progressive Diagnostic Narrowing...**

**Final Professional Diagnosis:**
- **Root Cause**: Mass airflow sensor contamination affecting fuel trim calculations
- **Technical Analysis**: MAF sensor reading 15% below specification causing ECM to reduce fuel delivery under load
- **Recommended Procedure**: MAF sensor cleaning/replacement, fuel trim reset, road test verification
- **Parts Required**: OEM mass airflow sensor assembly  
- **Labor Estimate**: 0.5 hours diagnostic, 0.3 hours R&R
- **Total Cost**: $180-$320 (depending on OEM vs aftermarket sensor)
- **Urgency**: Priority (affects drivability and fuel economy)
